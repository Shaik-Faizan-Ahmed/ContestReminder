# Project Brief: Contest Reminder

### Executive Summary

The Contest Reminder is a simple mobile app for Android and iOS that lists upcoming coding contests from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeChef, and Codeforces. Its primary purpose is to solve the problem of students and developers missing contests due to cluttered existing apps or the inconvenience of setting manual alarms. The app's core value proposition is a clean, focused user interface combined with a powerful and reliable system-level alarm feature, ensuring users never miss a contest they want to participate in.

### Problem Statement

Coding contest participants, particularly students, face a significant challenge in keeping track of and remembering upcoming events across multiple platforms. The current landscape of solutions is cluttered with overly complex applications that obscure the essential information users need. This forces them to rely on setting manual reminders in separate, generic alarm or calendar apps—an extra step that is often forgotten in a busy schedule.

The impact is straightforward: users miss contests they were eager to join. This is more than a minor inconvenience; it breaks their learning momentum and the motivational streak they are trying to build. Existing apps fail to solve this because their "reminders" are typically passive, easily-missed system notifications rather than true, reliable alarms. There is a clear and present need for a solution that directly and reliably addresses this core pain point.

### Proposed Solution

Our proposed solution is a mobile application, **Contest Reminder**, designed with a singular focus: to ensure users never miss a coding contest they want to attend. The core of the app will be a clean, simple, card-based interface that lists upcoming contests from platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank. Each contest card will feature a clear, one-tap action to set a reminder.

The key differentiator is the nature of this reminder. Unlike competitors that use easily-missed notifications, our app will set a **true, system-level alarm** that functions reliably even when the app is closed. This feature directly addresses the primary pain point and is the cornerstone of the user experience.

This solution will succeed because it prioritizes simplicity and reliability over feature-clutter. By delivering a beautiful, intuitive UI and a rock-solid alarm function, we will provide a tool that is not only useful but also a delight to use, helping our users stay motivated and consistent in their learning journey.

### Target Users

#### Primary User Segment: The Ambitious Student

This segment represents students and early-career developers who are driven to improve their coding skills through competitive programming.

*   **Profile:** Tech-savvy individuals, typically in high school or university, who are deeply engaged in the coding community. They are active on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeChef.
*   **Behaviors:** They actively seek out and participate in multiple coding contests per week as a primary method of learning and practice. They currently use a patchwork of methods to track contests, from checking websites daily to manually setting alarms, which often fails.
*   **Needs & Pains:** They need a simple, centralized place to view upcoming contests and, most importantly, a foolproof method to remind them before a contest begins. They are frustrated by overly complex apps and unreliable, passive notifications that cause them to miss events.
*   **Goals:** Their primary goal is to build and maintain a consistent streak of contest participation to accelerate their learning and stay motivated.

### Goals & Success Metrics

#### Business Objectives
*   Successfully launch a stable, functional MVP for both iOS and Android within 4 months.
*   Achieve 10,000 downloads across both platforms within 6 months post-launch.
*   Establish the app as the go-to, trusted tool for contest reminders, validated by positive community feedback and word-of-mouth growth.

#### User Success Metrics
*   Users feel confident and "in control," knowing they will not miss a contest they've set a reminder for.
*   A high percentage of users who view a contest's details proceed to set an alarm for it.
*   Users report a measurable increase in their contest participation rate after adopting the app.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*   **Weekly Active Users (WAU):** A measure of ongoing user engagement.
*   **Alarm Set Rate:** The percentage of contest detail views that result in an alarm being set. We'll aim for >70%.
*   **App Store Rating:** Target an average rating of 4.7 stars or higher.
*   **Day 7 Retention Rate:** The percentage of users who return to the app 7 days after their first session. Target >40%.

### MVP Scope

#### Core Features (Must Have)
*   **Simple Contest List:** A clean, vertical, card-based view of upcoming contests from a limited set of initial platforms (e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces).
*   **Reliable System Alarm:** The ability to set a non-negotiable, system-level alarm for any contest with a single tap. This is the killer feature.
*   **Countdown Timer:** Each contest card will display a live countdown to its start time to create a sense of urgency and excitement.
*   **Zero-Friction Entry:** All core features will be available immediately upon opening the app, with no login or signup required.

#### Out of Scope for MVP
*   User accounts, profiles, and any form of login.
*   Gamification features like participation streaks or points.
*   Advanced filtering, sorting, or searching of the contest list.
*   Support for more than the initial 2-3 contest platforms.
*   Any social features (e.g., sharing, comments, leaderboards).
*   Customizable alarm settings (e.g., multiple reminders, custom sounds).

#### MVP Success Criteria
The MVP will be deemed a success when the core loop—viewing contests and setting reliable alarms—functions flawlessly for the vast majority of users. Success will be measured by achieving an App Store rating of 4.7+ stars, coupled with qualitative feedback that explicitly praises the app's simplicity and the reliability of its alarm feature.

### Post-MVP Vision

#### Phase 2 Features
*   **Gamification & Streaks:** Introduce optional user accounts to allow for tracking contest participation streaks, directly supporting the user's core motivation to stay consistent.
*   **Expanded Platform Support:** Incrementally add more contest platforms (e.g., HackerEarth, AtCoder) based on user feedback and demand.
*   **Advanced Filtering:** Allow users to filter contests by platform, duration, or type.

#### Long-term Vision
In the long term, Contest Reminder aims to evolve from a simple utility into a motivational companion for a developer's entire competitive programming journey. It will be the tool that not only prevents them from missing a single contest but also visualizes their progress and dedication over time, helping them stay engaged and achieve their learning goals.

#### Expansion Opportunities
*   **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Proactively suggest contests to users based on their skill level, participation history, and stated goals.
*   **Calendar Integration:** Allow users to sync contest reminders with their native calendar app.
*   **Community & Social Layers:** Introduce features that allow users to see which contests their friends are participating in, fostering a sense of community.

### Technical Considerations

#### Platform Requirements
*   **Target Platforms:** iOS and Android.
*   **OS Support:** The app should support the latest two major versions of both iOS and Android.
*   **Performance Requirements:** The application must be lightweight, launch quickly (<2 seconds), and provide a smooth, responsive scrolling experience.

#### Technology Preferences
*   **Mobile Framework:** A cross-platform framework like **Flutter** or **React Native** is strongly preferred to ensure a consistent user experience and efficient development for both platforms.
*   **Backend:** For the MVP, a dedicated backend should not be necessary. The app will fetch data directly from the public APIs of the contest platforms.
*   **Database:** No local or remote database is required for the MVP.

#### Architecture Considerations
*   **API Integration:** The architecture must be designed to gracefully handle interactions with multiple third-party APIs. This includes managing potential API instability, rate limiting, and breaking changes.
*   **System Alarm Integration:** This is the most critical and complex technical component. The architecture must accommodate the distinct native APIs for both Android and iOS to implement a reliable, system-level alarm.
*   **Security:** As the MVP will not handle user data or accounts, the primary security concern is the secure storage of any API keys required by the contest platforms.

### Constraints & Assumptions

#### Constraints
*   **Timeline:** We are aiming for an MVP launch within a 4-month timeframe.
*   **Resources:** This project will be executed by a small, agile team with limited resources. Development efficiency is paramount.
*   **Technical:** The project is fundamentally constrained by the availability, reliability, and terms of service of the third-party APIs for contest platforms. The implementation of the native alarm feature is also a significant technical hurdle.

#### Key Assumptions
*   **API Availability:** We assume that stable, public APIs are available from our initial target platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.) and that we can use them without incurring costs.
*   **Alarm Feasibility:** We assume it is technically feasible to create a cross-platform alarm feature that is 100% reliable and functions as a true system-level process, not a simple notification.
*   **User Desire for Simplicity:** We assume that users will value a simple, focused application significantly more than a feature-rich but cluttered one.
*   **Organic Growth:** We assume the app's value proposition is strong enough to drive initial adoption through word-of-mouth within coding communities, without a dedicated marketing budget.

### Risks & Open Questions

#### Key Risks
*   **API Unreliability (High Impact):** The entire application depends on third-party APIs from contest platforms. These APIs could be unstable, change without notice, or have restrictive terms of use, presenting a critical risk to our core functionality.
*   **Alarm Implementation Failure (High Impact):** The app's primary value proposition rests on its ability to deliver a 100% reliable system alarm. Failing to implement this flawlessly across all target devices and OS versions would render the app useless and destroy user trust.
*   **Poor User Experience (Medium Impact):** If the UI is not perceived as simple, clean, and intuitive, users may abandon the app, even if the underlying technology works perfectly.

#### Open Questions
*   Which 2-3 contest platforms provide the most value for an MVP launch?
*   What are the precise technical limitations and terms of service for each target API?
*   What is the most robust technical strategy for implementing the native alarm feature on both iOS and Android?
*   How should the app handle time zones to ensure alarms are accurate for a global user base?

#### Areas Needing Further Research
*   **Technical Spike: Alarm Proof-of-Concept:** A focused technical investigation is required to build a prototype of the native alarm functionality to validate its feasibility before full development begins.
*   **API Analysis:** A thorough review of the documentation, stability, and usage policies for the top 5 potential contest platform APIs.
*   **UI/UX Prototyping:** Create simple wireframes or mockups to test the usability of the core user flow with potential users.

### Appendices

#### A. Research Summary
Initial project direction was established in a brainstorming session held on 2025-09-02. Key findings from this session include:
*   A strong user desire for simplicity and a focused feature set.
*   The absolute necessity of a reliable, system-level alarm, which was identified as the single most critical make-or-break feature.
*   The core user motivation is not just about winning contests, but about maintaining a consistent learning momentum and participation streak.

#### B. Stakeholder Input
Key input was gathered through role-playing two user personas:
*   **"Priya" (The Busy Student):** Emphasized the need for a simple UI, no login requirement, and an easy way to set alarms.
*   **"David" (The Skeptical Student):** Stated that the app would be instantly deleted if the "alarms" were just standard, easily-missed notifications. The feature's success depends on it being a true, reliable alarm.
