# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

*   Launch a stable, functional MVP for both iOS and Android.
*   Achieve significant user adoption (e.g., 10,000 downloads) within six months post-launch.
*   Become the trusted, go-to tool for coding contest reminders.
*   Ensure users feel confident they will not miss a contest they've set a reminder for.
*   Drive a high rate of alarm-setting on contest detail views.
*   Help users increase their contest participation rate.

## Background Context

The Contest Reminder app addresses a key pain point for students and developers: missing coding contests due to cluttered apps and the unreliability of manual reminders. Existing solutions often use passive notifications that are easily missed, breaking a user's learning momentum.

This project aims to solve this by providing a mobile application with a clean, simple interface focused on one core function: setting a **true, system-level alarm** for upcoming contests. By prioritizing reliability and ease of use, the app will provide a delightful, focused experience that helps users stay consistent in their competitive programming journey.
