# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience must be defined by **simplicity, clarity, and reliability**. The app should feel like a dependable, single-purpose utility that gets the job done with zero friction. The design should be clean, modern, and intuitive, making the process of viewing contests and setting alarms feel effortless and reassuring. The ultimate goal is an experience that is not just functional but also a delight to use.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Vertical Feed:** The primary interface will be a vertically scrolling list of contest cards, a familiar and intuitive pattern.
*   **One-Tap Action:** The core interaction for setting a reminder must be a single, unambiguous tap on a clear call-to-action element on each contest card.
*   **Minimalism:** The UI will avoid any clutter. Information will be presented clearly and concisely, with no unnecessary steps or distractions from the core user flow.

## Core Screens and Views

For the MVP, we will focus on a single, primary screen:
*   **Contest List Screen:** This view will display the vertically scrolling list of upcoming contest cards. It is the heart of the application where users will spend all of their time. No other screens are in scope for the MVP.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

While not explicitly defined in the brief, we should aim for **WCAG AA** compliance as a standard to ensure the app is usable by people with disabilities. This includes sufficient color contrast, clear typography, and support for screen readers.

## Branding

No specific branding guidelines have been provided. The aesthetic should be clean, modern, and minimalist, with a focus on readability and ease of use. The visual design should support the core values of simplicity and reliability.

## Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform

The application will target mobile devices on both **iOS and Android**, developed using a cross-platform framework to ensure a consistent experience.
