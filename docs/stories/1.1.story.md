# Story 1.1: Project Setup & CI/CD Foundation

*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want** a new, empty cross-platform mobile application with a basic CI/CD pipeline,
*   **so that** I have a stable foundation to start building features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new Git repository is created for the project.
2.  A new project is initialized using a cross-platform framework (Flutter).
3.  The default "Hello World" application runs successfully on both an iOS simulator and an Android emulator.
4.  A basic CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) is configured to build the application on every push to the main branch.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous story. This is the first story of the project.

### Tech Stack & Framework

*   **Framework**: Flutter (Stable) [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
*   **Language**: Dart (Stable) [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
*   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]
*   **Version Control**: Git [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure

*   The project will be initialized using `flutter create contest_reminder`. This will generate the standard Flutter project structure. [Source: architecture/8-unified-project-structure.md]
*   The directory structure should follow the guidelines in `architecture/8-unified-project-structure.md`.

### Coding Standards

*   All code must adhere to the "Effective Dart" guidelines. [Source: architecture/13-coding-standards.md]
*   Naming conventions outlined in `architecture/13-coding-standards.md` must be followed.

### Testing Requirements

*   The initial project includes a default unit test. The CI/CD pipeline should be configured to run this test. [Source: architecture/12-testing-strategy.md]

### CI/CD Pipeline

*   A new GitHub Actions workflow file should be created at `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
*   The workflow should trigger on `push` to the `main` branch.
*   The workflow should perform the following steps:
    1.  Checkout the code.
    2.  Set up Flutter environment.
    3.  Run `flutter pub get`.
    4.  Run `flutter test`.
    5.  Run `flutter build apk --debug` (for Android).
    6.  Run `flutter build ios --no-codesign` (for iOS).

    *   [x] Create a `.github/workflows` directory.
    *   [x] Create a `build.yml` file inside the workflows directory.
    *   [x] Implement the workflow steps as defined in the Dev Notes. [Source: architecture/10-deployment-architecture.md]
    *   [x] Verify the pipeline runs successfully on a push to the `main` branch.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-02

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The initial project setup uses the standard Flutter template, which adheres to the "Effective Dart" guidelines and project coding standards. The code is clean, well-structured, and requires no refactoring.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✓]
- All ACs Met: [✓]

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] All tasks completed and verified.

### Security Review

No security concerns were found. The CI/CD pipeline correctly avoids using code signing for debug builds.

### Performance Considerations

Not applicable for the default counter application.

### Files Modified During Review

None.

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-project-setup-cicd-foundation.yml

### Recommended Status

[✓ Ready for Done]
