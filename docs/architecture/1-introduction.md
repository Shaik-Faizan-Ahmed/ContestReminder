# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for ContestReminder, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## 1.1. Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD, this is a greenfield project. The PRD recommends a cross-platform framework (Flutter or React Native) and the `front-end-spec.md` specifies the use of the Material 3 design system.

Given the client-side only architecture (NFR5) and the need for reliable native alarm integration (a high-risk feature), I recommend starting with a minimal, clean project template provided by the chosen framework (e.g., `flutter create` or `npx react-native init`). This avoids unnecessary dependencies and constraints from more opinionated starter kits, allowing us to focus on the core, high-risk features first.
