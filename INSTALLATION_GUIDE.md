## ✅ Pre-Build Checklist

Before building the APK, ensure you have completed all the following steps:

### 1. Dependencies Installation
```bash
cd ContestReminder
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Code Generation
```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### 3. Clean Build Environment
```bash
flutter clean
```

## 🔧 Building the APK

### Option 1: Using Build Script (Recommended)

**For Windows:**
```bash
build_release.bat
```

**For Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x build_release.sh
./build_release.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Build
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

## 📱 APK Locations

After successful build, you'll find the APK files in:

```
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/
├── app-arm64-v8a-release.apk     (Most modern Android devices - 64-bit ARM)
├── app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk   (Older Android devices - 32-bit ARM)  
├── app-x86_64-release.apk        (Android emulators - 64-bit x86)
└── app-release.apk               (Universal APK - larger file size)
```

**📋 Recommended APK:** Use `app-arm64-v8a-release.apk` for most modern Android devices.

## 🔍 Testing the Application

### 1. Install the APK
```bash
# Via ADB (if device is connected)
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk

# Or transfer the APK file to your device and install manually
```

### 2. Grant Permissions
When you first open the app, it will request:
- **Notification Permission**: Required for contest reminders
- **Exact Alarm Permission**: Required for precise timing (Android 12+)
- **Background Activity**: For notifications to work when app is closed

### 3. Test Core Features

#### ✅ Contest Loading
1. Open the app
2. Verify contests are loading from the API
3. Pull down to refresh and ensure new data loads
4. Check that contests are sorted by start time

#### ✅ Reminder Functionality  
1. Tap "Set Reminder" on an upcoming contest
2. Verify the button changes to "Cancel Reminder"
3. Check notification appears 5 minutes before contest time
4. Test canceling reminders

#### ✅ URL Copying
1. Tap "Copy URL" on any contest
2. Verify "URL copied to clipboard" message appears
3. Test pasting the URL in a browser

#### ✅ Error Handling
1. Turn off internet and pull to refresh
2. Verify error message appears with retry option
3. Turn internet back on and test retry functionality

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Build Fails
```
Error: Could not find a file named "pubspec.yaml"
```
**Solution:** Make sure you're in the correct directory (`ContestReminder/`)

### Issue 2: Code Generation Errors
```
Error: No builder found for "riverpod_generator"
```
**Solution:** 
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter packages pub run build_runner clean
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Issue 3: Notifications Not Working
**Solutions:**
- Check app permissions in device settings
- Ensure "Exact Alarms" permission is granted
- Verify device isn't in battery optimization mode for the app
- Test on different Android versions if possible

### Issue 4: API Connection Issues
```
Error: Failed to connect to the CLIST.by API
```
**Solutions:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify API endpoint is accessible
- Try on different network (mobile data vs WiFi)

### Issue 5: App Crashes on Startup
**Solutions:**
- Check Flutter doctor: `flutter doctor`
- Rebuild with: `flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter run`
- Check device logs: `adb logcat`

## 📊 Performance Testing

### Memory Usage
- Monitor app memory usage during normal operation
- Should stay under 100MB for typical usage

### Battery Impact
- Test notifications don't cause excessive battery drain
